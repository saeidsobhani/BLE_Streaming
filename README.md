## üéØ Project Overview  
This project investigates how to **optimize Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) data transmission** between a smartwatch and a host computer using **adaptive compression and quantization methods**.  

The research focuses on the **Bangle.js 1** smartwatch platform, equipped with motion and magnetic sensors. The goal is to improve BLE throughput efficiency for streaming sensor data (accelerometer, magnetometer) and visual data (bitmap sequences) while maintaining energy efficiency and low latency.

## üß† Research Goals  
- Analyze BLE communication limitations on embedded wearable devices.  
- Design adaptive algorithms to optimize data transmission based on BLE bandwidth and context.  
- Evaluate BLE throughput and latency when sending:  
  1. Sensor data (accelerometer + magnetometer).  
  2. Bitmap sequences to the watch display.  
- Develop a **WebBLE-based real-time demonstrator** to visualize performance improvements.
