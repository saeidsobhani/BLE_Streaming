## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview  
This project investigates how to **optimize Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) data transmission** between a smartwatch and a host computer using **adaptive compression and quantization methods**.  

The research focuses on the **[Bangle.js 1](https://www.espruino.com/Bangle.js)** smartwatch platform, equipped with motion and magnetic sensors. The goal is to improve BLE throughput efficiency for streaming sensor data (accelerometer, magnetometer) and visual data (bitmap sequences).

## ðŸ§  Research Goals  
- Analyze BLE communication limitations on embedded wearable devices.  
- Design adaptive algorithms to optimize data transmission based on BLE bandwidth and context.  
- Evaluate BLE throughput and latency when sending:  
  1. Sensor data (accelerometer + magnetometer).  
  2. Bitmap sequences to the watch display.  
- Develop a **WebBLE-based real-time demonstrator** to visualize performance improvements.
